todays take aways i have are, i was able to send a form through a submit button to a different location on the browser and i understand that i am unable to send documents to a big browser or website but instead i can send it to the request bin, i was able to learn how to have a seperate page open in vs code from my html page called css and use that page for styling my html and today i got more of an understanding of how the layout of a form document is and how to submit it using html.
