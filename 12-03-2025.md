i had an awesome day, i got to complete a few more exersises and i enjoyed doing the lesson with larrisa this afternoon because i got to do a task on the t.v and got it right. highlight of the day was hstarbucks today. i need to do more study from home, i am still struggling to get into the mode of working outside of class.
