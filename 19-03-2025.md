today i was sleepy, but i did that thing again when all i needed was for someone to say one thing and i was smooth sailing with my code, its funny how that works. one thing i took away from today is that i really like engineering and i want to do better things with it. highlight for my day is having some different weather for a change i actually like the rainy weather tbh
