my take away today is, im very happy i caught the bus today i made it on time to recieve some cool things from Martha. i found that i should be doing more studying while at home so i can be ahead of my work so thngs are abit more clearer in class. i'm so greatfull to be here and happy that i am still here after the onboarding time.
