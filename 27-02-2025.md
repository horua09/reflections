i had a chellange today with understanding the different variables, but i got to know a string of text is different to numbers and boleons. my highlight of the day was getting my first kiwiharvest to take home. i found java script quite fun and once i have got more confident with it i want to learn what all the different functions javascript can do and what they will look like when i search them on console.
