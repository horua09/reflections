i still struggled with exersise number 13 from yesterday, but with help from my classmates and larissa i pulled through. i have also been struggiling with my anxiety today, because when it came to reading the atomic habits lesson for today i could not comprehend what it said which made me feel really upset. on the brighter side i am looking forward to learning more about javascript.
