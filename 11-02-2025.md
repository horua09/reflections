i took away from todays learning, that there are multiple input types that can be used to change the outlay of inputs, if i use a "required" element it makes the input compalssary to be filled in or else the form will be unable for submission and i learnt the basics of how to create a form but i am still figuring out how to make a large form with alot of different inputs.
