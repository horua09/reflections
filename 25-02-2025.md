i found today was great, my projects are coming along sorta slow now that i am up to the score sheet frontend mentor project. today i found myself looking back at csstricks/flexbox online and getting a couple good pointers off there and also from sylvia. i need to get a headstart on javascript for this friday so its all not very new but so i have somewhat of an understanding before i get started.
