todays learning was a little intense, by intense i mean it was just quiet alot to take in. but i am glad that sylvia was here to walk me through a couple things. i had a great time doing exersise 3 on my own, i thought i done well. todays highlight for me is its such a nice day to get into some coding and im feeling well rested today so i am looking forward to the next two days.
