great day today, ive set one thing that i would like to get better at during the weekend, and thats learning more about functions and how they work. one good thing about today was i felt some what confident in myself doing the review so that tells me i am picking up on javascript rather easier than i thought i would at the biggening of the week. i also thought about how, after only three days of learning javascript i am doing a test already, i found that quite strange considering this is my first time ever knowing what javascript is.
