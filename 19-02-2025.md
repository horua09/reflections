i had a great day getting into flexboxes and learning about flex containers. the highlight of my day would have to be going and looking at the hospice shop down the road and picking up a new hoodie. anyway i took away a couple things from today, i learnt the difference between "align-items and justify-content" and i got to win the frog game today to.
